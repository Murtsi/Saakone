# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App project! This repository contains two versions of a simple weather application: a Python-only version and a web-based version using HTML and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Python Version**: A simple application that fetches and displays weather data.
- **HTML & JavaScript Version**: A web-based application with a user-friendly interface for displaying weather data.


### Python Version

- After running `python.py`, you will be prompted to enter a city name.
- The application will fetch and display the current weather for the specified city.

### HTML & JavaScript Version

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Enter the city name in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button.
- The current weather for the specified city will be displayed on the page.

## API Key

Both versions of the application use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You will need an API key to use this service.

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to get your API key.
2. **For the Python version**: Place your API key in the `python.py` file.
3. **For the HTML & JavaScript version**: Place your API key in the `script.js` file.
